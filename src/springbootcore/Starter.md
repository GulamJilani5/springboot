# Starter
- Starters follow a convention-over-configuration approach.
- Each starter is a **Maven/Gradle** dependency (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`) that pulls in all the necessary 
   libraries for a particular functionality, such as **web development**, **data access**,  **security** or **testing**.
