# Spring Boot Actuator
- Production-ready features to monitor and manage your application.
- Check the applicationâ€™s health, view metrics, inspect beans, or even shut down the application programmatically.

### Features
##### 1. Monitoring Application Health: 
- `/actuator/health`
- Check if application is running and its dependencies (e.g., database, message broker) are available. 
- This is useful for load balancers or orchestration tools like Kubernetes to determine if a service is healthy.
`/actuator/health`
##### 2. Performance Monitoring:
- `/actuator/metrics` 
- Track metrics like **JVM memory usage**, **CPU usage**, or the number of **HTTP requests** processed.
- `jvm.memory.used`
##### 3. Dynamic Configuration:
- `/actuator/env` - Inspect environment
- `/actuator/loggers` - change logging levels without restarting the application.

##### 4. Auditing and Compliance:
- `/actuator/auditevents` track user actions (e.g., **login attempts**) for security auditing.
