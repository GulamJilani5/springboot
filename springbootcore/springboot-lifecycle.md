# ⏺️ Spring Boot Application Lifecycle - From Start to Finish

Ever wondered what happens when you start & stop a Spring Boot application?

## ➡️ Startup Phase

- Entry Point → Application starts from the main() method annotated with @SpringBootApplication.
- Auto-Configuration→ Beans are auto-configured based on classpath dependencies (@EnableAutoConfiguration).
- Component Scanning → Detects @Component, @Service, @Repository, etc. and registers them in the **ApplicationContext**.
- Embedded Server → For web apps, an embedded server (Tomcat/Jetty/Undertow) starts, making it standalone.

## ➡️ Request Processing Phase (Web Applications)

- Client Request → A client sends an encrypted request.
- SSL/TLS Termination → Embedded server decrypts the request via SSL certificate.
- DispatcherServlet → Maps the request to the
- correct controller using HandlerMapping.
- Controller Processing → Controller handles logic & interacts with services/repositories.
- Response Generation → Response sent back via DispatcherServlet.
- Client Response → Server encrypts the response & delivers it securely.

## ➡️ Shutdown Phase

- Shutdown Trigger → Application stops (manual kill signal, container stop, etc.).
- SpringApplication Shutdown Hook → Gracefully closes the ApplicationContext.
- Bean Destruction→ Executes `@PreDestroy` methods & `DisposableBean.destroy()`.
- Resource Cleanup→ Closes DB connections, thread pools, schedulers, etc.
- Graceful Exit → Publishes `ContextClosedEvent` → JVM exits cleanly.
