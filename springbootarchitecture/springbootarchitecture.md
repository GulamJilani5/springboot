# ðŸ†š DTO vs Mapper in Spring Boot

In a layered architecture, **DTO** and **Mapper** serve different roles:

---

## ðŸ“„ DTO (Data Transfer Object)

**Purpose**:  
A DTO is a plain Java object used to carry data between layers (e.g., from the controller to the service or to the client). It helps to avoid exposing the internal entity structure directly.

**ðŸ”‘ Key Points**:
- Does **not contain business logic**.
- Used for **input/output in REST APIs**.
- Contains only necessary fields to expose.
- Can include validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.

**ðŸ§ª Example**:
   
        public class UserDTO {
            private String name;
            private String email;
            // getters and setters
        }

--- 

## ðŸ”„ Mapper

#### Purpose:
  A **Mapper** is a component used to **convert between entities and DTOs** (or between different 
  types of DTOs). This keeps your service and controller code clean and separated from conversion logic.

#### ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
- Acts as a **bridge** between your entity and DTO.
- You can write it **manually** or use tools like **MapStruct**, **ModelMapper**, etc.
- Encourages **Separation of Concerns**.
